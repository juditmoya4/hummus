    <h1> Quick hummus recipe</h1>

    <p> Recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing. It has been adapted from a number of different <br> recipes that I have read over the years.
    Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. <br>It is very tasty with salad, grilled meats and pitta breads.</p>

<h3>Ingredientss</h3>
    <ul>
   <li> 1 can (400g) of chick peas (garbanzo beans)</li>
   <li>175g of tahini
    <li>6 sundried tomatoes</li>
    <li>Half a red pepper</li>
    <li>A pinch of cayenne pepper</li>
    <li>1 clove of garlic</li>
    <li>A dash of olive oil</li>

</ul>

<h3>Instructions</h3>

<ul>
    <li> Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely</li>
    <li>Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely</li>
    <li> Add all the ingredients into a food processor</li>
    <li> Process all the ingredients into a paste.</li>
    <li> If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time</li>
    <li> If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time</li>
</ul>

    <p> a different flavour, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili pepper, <br> and chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. Experiment and see what works for you.</p>

    <h2>Storage</h2>

    <p>Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be able to use it for about a <br> week after you've made it. If it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it.</p>

    <p> Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.</p>
